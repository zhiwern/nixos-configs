# nixos-configs
My personal nixos configs. Updated regularly.

# Getting started
The nixos configuration does not use home manager nor does it use flakes (yet). Here are some of the changes it makes to the system:
1. Changes the bootloader to GRUB
2. Disables kernel mitigations
3. Install some softwares
4. Installs some Gnome extensions
5. Installs some fonts and icons
6. Enables OS prober
7. Enables zsh with oh my zsh
8. Removes firefox in favour of Chrome
9. Switches to Linux zen kernel

# Nvidia
The pain of nvidia. File is dead.

# Things to do
- Add some zsh configurations here
- Use homemanager
- Use flakes
- Change some gnome settings via configuration
- Write some update scripts
- Automatic git commits
- Configure Wayland, only X11 is stable somehow??
- Cleanup some directory stuffs
- Find a better fetch software for my terminal
